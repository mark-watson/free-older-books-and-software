2. CONSULTANT agrees to hold CUSTOMER's proprietary information in strict confidence and will make all reasonable efforts to not disclose any proprietary information to any third party. Proprietary information includes any technical and business information that is not in the public domain or common knowledge. Both the CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER agree to take all reasonable precautions for safeguarding each others intellectual property. This paragraph has the following exception for projects developed under an open source software license: software developed will be released publicly, but, details of the CUSTOMER's business will remain confidential. CUSTOMER agrees to only furnish data, access to databases, and code with CONSULTANT that they have the rights and authorization to share with CONSULTANT.

3. Both the CONSULTANT and CUSTOMER understand that in any project there is some legal risk of infringing on a copyright, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary right held by any third party.

CONSULTANT does maintain a permanent copy of the text (but not attachments) of all emails with CUSTOMER and work logs.
